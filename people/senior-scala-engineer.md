for Luna, a project said by Singularity University to have the potential to
change the lives of one-billion people. If you bring strong technical skills and
have a passion for collaboration, this role could be for you.

As a senior cloud software engineer, you'll be leading the effort to design and
develop our new SaaS offering, providing a web-based version of Luna to our
clients. Your work will be integral to the next phase of Luna's development, as
we expand our offering beyond the open-source project. You'll be able to work

indelible stamp on Luna's future.

As a senior scala software engineer you'll be in charge of building the SaaS
offering for Luna, hosting both the language and its IDE in the cloud.
This will involve:

- Working closely with the internal teams to design a secure and scalable SaaS
  architecture.
- Developing a SaaS solution based upon that design with robust tooling and
  reliability, as well as inbuilt support for collaboration.
- Contributing to the evolution of this vibrant open-source project by bringing
  a new component to its ecosystem and product offering.

#### The Skills We're Looking For
We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:

- Solid understanding of Scala language elements of functional programming.
- Understanding of immutability.
- JVM basics, memory model, threads, principles of work knowledge.
- Data structures and basic algorithms knowledge.
- Systems design & networking (understanding basic principles) .

- Experience working with Git and Linux.
- Scala on backend: servers, web.
- Akka library: actors, streams, http.
- Git and source management flows, deployment.
- Cats, cats-effect libraries .
- Messaging systems, protocols and design patterns .

It would be a big bonus if you also had:

- Experience with Cloud computing architectures (AWS, Google Cloud).
- Experience with container technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).
- Experience working in close conjunction with multiple product teams to ensure
  that the solutions you provide meet their needs.

## About Luna
Luna is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science
platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the
potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the
entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the
nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt
capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities
are limitless.

At Luna, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close
collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of
the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward
Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.

We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see
Luna succeed.

## Who You'll Work With
You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people
with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll
have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and
communication, and input is always welcomed.

We firmly believe that only by working _together_, rather than putting our team
members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Luna that can be.

## The Details
As part of the Luna team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at
home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San
Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules,
or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility
of equity as time goes on.

## How To Apply?
Send us an email at `jobs@luna-lang.org`, and tell us a little bit about
yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role! You can also tell
us about:

- Some of your past work or projects.
