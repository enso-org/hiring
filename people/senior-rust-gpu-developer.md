## Senior Rust GPU Developer
[Luna](https://luna-lang.org) is looking for a senior graphics developer to take
charge of the design, development, and evolution of a new WebGL-based GUI for
Luna, a project said by Singularity University to have the potential to change
the lives of one-billion people. If you bring strong technical skills and a
passion for performance, this could be the role for you.

As a senior graphics developer you'll be a key part of bringing the vision for
Luna 2.0 into reality, with your work being integral to the realisation of the
next iteration of Luna. You'll be able to collaborate with world-class team of
skilled engineers, community managers, and business developers (from Bloomberg,
PayPal, and GitHub to name a few), and make your indelible mark on the future of
Luna.

#### What You'll Do
As a senior graphics developer, you'll be responsible for designing and building
a high-performance renderer based on web technologies for use in the Luna IDE:
Luna Studio. This will involve:

- Working closely with stakeholders and customers to design the new GUI for Luna
  Studio.
- Developing a design for the new renderer that will be used to implement this
  GUI.
- Implementing the new renderer in a high-performance manner on top of WebGL and
  Rust (via Web Assembly).
- Building a next-generation UI framework using this renderer for use in Luna
  Studio.
- Using this UI framework to build the new GUI for Luna Studio itself.
- Debug performance issues to ensure that the renderer is capable of achieving
  high performance even on low-powered hardware.
- Creating visualisations for data science libraries using the renderer and
  D3.js.

#### The Skills We're Looking For
We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:

- A strong focus on both user experience and aesthetics.
- 3+ years experience with WebGL (or OpenGL).
- A deep understanding of graphics abstractions including: VAOs, FBOs, PBOs,
  buffer types, and asynchronous computation modes.
- A deep understanding of GPU techniques including: efficient buffer management,
  efficient GLSL construction, high-performance vector and font rendering,
  post-processing, 3D scene description (with nested objects), lights, cameras,
  and animation.
- 2+ years experience with Rust, including experience writing `unsafe` code for
  FFI and performance, and using the macro system for metaprogramming. You
  should be able to write _idiomatic_ rust code.
- Practical experience building high-performance graphical interfaces for
  end-user-facing applications.

As part of the hiring process for this job posting we're _very_ interested in
your previous work in these areas. Please link us to your Rust projects, blog
posts and shadertoy shaders if you have them! It's important for us to
understand your experience at the start of the hiring process.

It would be a big bonus if you had:

- Experience with Rust's WASM toolchain, with wasm-bindgen, and experience with
  WASM itself.
- Experience with visual programming systems such as Houdini, Max/MSP, Lab VIEW,
  or Touch Designer.
- Knowledge of the runtime and memory models used by various JavaScript virtual
  machines.
- Knowledge of D3.js, and experience using it to visualise data.

You don't have to match _all_ of the skills above to apply!

## About Luna
Luna is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science
platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the
potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the
entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the
nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt
capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities
are limitless.

At Luna, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close
collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of
the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward
Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.

We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see
Luna succeed.

## Who You'll Work With
You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people
with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll
have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and
communication, and input is always welcomed.

We firmly believe that only by working _together_, rather than putting our team
members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Luna that can be.

## The Details
As part of the Luna team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at
home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San
Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules,
or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility
of equity as time goes on.

## How To Apply?
Send us an email at `jobs@luna-lang.org`, and tell us a little bit about
yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role! You can also tell
us about:

- Some of your past work or projects.
- Why you'd like to work on Luna, and where you imagine Luna being in 5 years.
- The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.
- Whether you take pride in your ability to communicate clearly and efficiently
  with your team.
