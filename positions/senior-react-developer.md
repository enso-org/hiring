# Senior TypeScript Developer
Hi, we are Enso (Y Combinator S21)! We are looking for a talented TypeScript/React 
developer for our cloud solution. We are a remote first company, working in 
Europe and the USA.

## What is Enso?
**From the business perspective**, Enso is a no-code interactive data transformation
tool. It lets you load, blend, and analyze your data, and then automate the 
whole process, simply by connecting visual components together. It can be used for
both in-memory data processing, as well as SQL analytics and transformations on modern
data stack (ELT). Enso has the potential to disrupt the data analytics industry over the next five years. 
Currently, the market operates using old-fashioned, limited, and non-extensible
software which has been unable to keep up with businesses as they transition to 
the cloud.

**From a technical perspective**, Enso is a purely functional, programming 
language with a double visual and textual syntax representation and a polyglot
evaluation model. It means that you can mix other languages with Enso (Java, 
JavaScript, Python, R) without wrappers and with close-to-zero performance overhead.

## Who are we looking for?
Enso would be a great place for you if:
- You're an expert in TypeScript and React.js.
- You’re any race, color, religion, gender, national origin, political affiliation, 
  sexual orientation, marital status, disability, age.
- You like to laugh.
- You want to work hard, have fun doing it, and own projects from end-to-end.
- You are friendly and like to collaborate.
- You move fast and ask for help when needed.
- You value being part of a team and a community.
- You can set your ego aside because you know that good ideas can come from anywhere.
- You enjoy working in public, putting yourself out there and showing your learning.
- You appreciate a competitive salary.

## Responsibilities
As a senior TypeScript developer developer you'll be in charge of the creation of the
new front-end for the Enso Cloud. This will involve:

- Working closely with stakeholders and customers to design an interface that is
  both intuitive and fluid to work with.
- Implementing these solutions using modern front-end web-development
  technologies in a cross-platform manner to create an application that can run
  both in the browser and in electron.
- Managing and working around cross-browser compatibility issues.
- Contributing to the testing and integration of the user interface, from both
  functional and UI standpoints.


## Requirements
We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:

- A strong focus on both user experience and aesthetics.
- Strong practical experience implementing large-scale, user-facing applications
  in TypeScript.
- A strong understanding, based on practical experience, of modern front-end
  frameworks, with a focus on React.
- An understanding of cross-browser compatibility issues, and experience working
  around such problems.
- Familiarity with front-end build tools such as Webpack and Gulp.
- Experience with testing tools, both for integration and for front-end (e.g.
  Selenium).

It would be a big bonus if you had:

- Experience with frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Next.js.
