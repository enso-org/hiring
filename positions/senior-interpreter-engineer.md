# Senior Programming Language Compiler Developer (GraalVM / Truffle)
Hi, we are Enso (Y Combinator S21)! We are looking for a skilled [GraalVM/Truffle](https://www.graalvm.org) interpreter 
developer to join our core team and help us develop the [Enso JIT Polyglot Compiler](https://enso.org/language#compiler). We are a remote first company, working in 
Europe and the USA.

## What is Enso?
**From the business perspective**, Enso is a no-code interactive data transformation 
tool. It lets you load, blend, and analyze your data, and then automate the 
whole process, simply by connecting visual components together. It can be used for 
both in-memory data processing, as well as SQL analytics and transformations on 
modern data stack (ELT). Enso has the potential to disrupt the data analytics 
industry over the next five years. 
Currently, the market operates using old-fashioned, limited, and non-extensible 
software which has been unable to keep up with businesses as they transition 
to the cloud.

**From the technical perspective**, Enso is a purely functional programming 
language with a double visual and textual syntax representation and a polyglot 
evaluation model. It means that you can mix other languages with Enso (Java, 
JavaScript, Python, R) without wrappers and with close-to-zero performance 
overhead. Enso’s GUI is based on a custom Rust-based WebGL vector shapes rendrer, 
while its compiler utilizes the GraalVM framework. [Click here to learn more](https://enso.org/language).

### Who are we looking for?
Enso would be a great place for you if:
- You're an expert at writing language interpreters.
- You’re any race, color, religion, gender, national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, 
  marital status, disability, age.
- You like to laugh.
- You want to work hard, have fun doing it, and own projects from end-to-end.
- You are friendly and like to collaborate.
- You move fast and ask for help when needed.
- You value being part of a team and a community.
- You can set your ego aside because you know that good ideas can come from anywhere.
- You enjoy working in public, putting yourself out there and showing your learning.
- You appreciate a competitive salary and significant stock options.

## Responsibilities
You’ll be responsible for designing and building the engine that executes Enso code. 
It includes a parser, a compiler that performs static analysis, a code generator, 
and a sophisticated interpreter for the language, all built on top of GraalVM. 
This will involve:
- Working closely with stakeholders and the IDE team to plan and implement 
  enhancements to the Enso runtime environment and user experience.
- Working to allow seamless interoperability between Enso and other languages 
  running on top of GraalVM.
- Implementing optimisations both in the Enso compiler and in the interpreter 
  itself, ensuring that Enso retains its high performance.
- Debugging issues with Enso’s performance and semantics to ensure that 
  the language remains easy to use for users.
- Designing and building extensions to the Enso standard libraries to 
  ensure a truly “batteries included” experience.

## Requirements
We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:
- A strong focus on user experience and performance.
- 3+ years commercial experience working on language runtimes, compilers, 
  or interpreters.
- 3+ years experience writing both Java and Scala.
- Practical experience debugging performance issues with language runtimes, 
  and with the JVM.
- A comprehensive understanding of the JVM and its performance behaviours, 
  including its execution model and garbage collectors, born of practical experience.

As part of the hiring process for this job posting we're very interested in your 
previous work in these areas. Please link us to any experiments or previous projects 
that you have in these areas! It's important for us to understand your experience at 
the start of the hiring process.
It would be a big bonus if you had:
- Experience with building interpreters using the Truffle framework on top of GraalVM.
- Experience building language-integrated tooling such as language servers and debuggers.
- Experience with visual programming systems such as Houdini, Max/MSP, LabVIEW or 
  Touch Designer.
- Experience using and developing software in purely-functional programming language 
  such as Haskell.
