# ☁️ Senior Cloud Rust Engineer

Hi, we are Enso ([ENSO.org](https://enso.org), Y Combinator S21)! We are looking for an amazing Cloud 
engineer to join our core team. We are a remote first company, working in 
Europe and the USA.

## What is Enso?

**From the business perspective**, Enso is a no-code interactive data transformation
tool. It lets you load, blend, and analyze your data, and then automate the 
whole process, simply by connecting visual components together. It can be used for
both in-memory data processing, as well as SQL analytics and transformations on modern
data stack (ELT). Enso has the potential to disrupt the data analytics industry over the next five years. 
Currently, the market operates using old-fashioned, limited, and non-extensible
software which has been unable to keep up with businesses as they transition to 
the cloud.

**From a technical perspective**, Enso is a purely functional, programming 
language with a double visual and textual syntax representation and a polyglot
evaluation model. It means that you can mix other languages with Enso (Java, 
JavaScript, Python, R) without wrappers and with close-to-zero performance overhead.
