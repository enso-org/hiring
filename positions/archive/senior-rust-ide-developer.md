# Senior Rust IDE Developer
Hi, we are Enso ([enso.org](https://enso.org), Y Combinator S21)! We are looking for a rock star Rust/WebGL 
developer to join our core team. We are a remote first company, working in 
Europe and the USA.

## What is Enso?
**From the business perspective**, Enso is a no-code interactive data transformation
tool. It lets you load, blend, and analyze your data, and then automate the 
whole process, simply by connecting visual components together. It can be used for both in-memory data processing, as well as SQL analytics and transformations on modern data stack (ELT). Enso has the
potential to disrupt the data analytics industry over the next five years. 
Currently, the market operates using old-fashioned, limited, and non-extensible
software which has been unable to keep up with businesses as they transition to 
the cloud.

**From a technical perspective**, Enso is a purely functional, programming 
language with a double visual and textual syntax representation and a polyglot
evaluation model. It means that you can mix other languages with Enso (Java, 
JavaScript, Python, R) without wrappers and with close-to-zero performance overhead.
Enso GUI is based on a custom Rust-based WebGL vector shapes renderer, while its 
compiler utilizes the GraalVM framework. [Click here to learn more](https://enso.org/language).

## Who are we looking for?
Enso would be a great place for you if:
- You're an expert in Rust.
- Youâ€™re any race, color, religion, gender, national origin, political affiliation, 
  sexual orientation, marital status, disability, age.
- You like to laugh.
- You want to work hard, have fun doing it, and own projects from end-to-end.
- You are friendly and like to collaborate.
- You move fast and ask for help when needed.
- You value being part of a team and a community.
- You can set your ego aside because you know that good ideas can come from anywhere.
- You enjoy working in public, putting yourself out there and showing your learning.
- You appreciate a competitive salary and significant stock options.


## Responsibilities
You'll be responsible for designing and building the visual layer of Enso. 
It includes a high-performance WebGL renderer, the Enso language graph editor, 
and its visualization system. This will involve:
- Working closely with stakeholders and customers to design how the Enso GUI 
  should operate.
- Developing the WebGL renderer that is used to implement this GUI.
- Building a next-generation UI framework using this renderer for use in Enso.
- Using this UI framework to build the GUI for Enso itself.
- Debugging performance issues to ensure that the renderer is capable of 
  achieving high performance even on low-powered hardware.
- Creating visualisations for data science libraries using the renderer and 
  other JavaScript libraries.


## Requirements
We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:

- A strong focus on both user experience and aesthetics.
- 3+ years commercial experience with Rust, including experience writing
  unsafe code for FFI and performance, and using the macro system for
  metaprogramming. You should be able to write idiomatic rust code.
- 2+ years experience with JavaScript, including debugging web stack
  performance issues.
- Practical experience building high-performance graphical interfaces
  for end-user-facing applications.

As part of the hiring process for this job posting we're very interested
in your previous work in these areas. Please link us to your Rust projects, 
blog posts and shadertoy shaders if you have them! It's important for us to
understand your experience at the start of the hiring process.

It would be a big bonus if you had:

- Experience with Rust's WASM toolchain, with wasm-bindgen, and experience with WASM itself.
- Experience with visual programming systems such as Houdini, Max/MSP, Lab VIEW, or Touch Designer.
- Knowledge of the runtime and memory models used by various JavaScript virtual machines.
- Knowledge of JavaScript visualization libraries.
- Experience with GPU programming (OpenGL, WebGL, DirectX).
