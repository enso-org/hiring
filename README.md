## About Enso
Enso ([enso.org](https://enso.org)) is the most interactive data transformation tool that you
have ever used. It lets you load, blend, analyze your data, and then automate the whole process, 
simply by connecting visual components together. It can be used for both in-memory data processing,
as well as SQL analytics and transformations on modern data stack (ELT). Enso has the
potential to disrupt the data analytics industry over the next five years. 
Currently, the market operates using old-fashioned, limited, and non-extensible
software which has been unable to keep up with businesses as they transition to 
the cloud.

At Enso, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and
business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds. We are backed by 
world-class investors, including Y Combinator. We welcome anybody to our team, 
as long as you have the desire and drive to see Enso succeed.
